<p> My first HTML file - the moment every changed!</p>
<p>My journey into web Development began with one powerful <br> language : <b>HTML</b>. At first , i thought building a website required  <br>some sort of magic. But I quickly realized HTML was more about <br> structure and clarify than complexity. In the Blog post , Iwant to walk <br> you through what i've learnerd so far </p>
<p>HTML stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language.</i> Its the backbone of every <br> webpage on the Internet. From paragraphd and images to videos and Form, <br> HTML tells the browser what each part of the page is.</p>
<h3>Why Semantic HTML Matters</h3>
<p>One of the important concepts i learned early on is the use of the <b>Semantic HTML.</b> <br> Tags like  <b>article, section and footer </b> help browsers and assistive technologies <br> understand the content's purpose.  </p>

<p>Using semantic tags makes your website more accessible and improves SEO. <br> Its also a cleaner way to organize your code.</p>
<h3>Building My First Webpage</h3>
<p>My first project was a simple portfolio site. I used HTML to create a homepage <br> with my name , a brief bio, and a few links to other pages. Here's a snippet of the the header I wrote:</p>

<p>It was such a rewarding experience to see my page live in the browser. It might not have been fancy,<br> but it was mine â€” and it worked! </p>
<h3>What I Plan to Learn Next</h3>
<p>After getting comfortable with HTML, my next step is to master CSS and then move on to Java script . <br> I want to make my sites more interactive and beautiful. Eventually I hope to learn modern framewoks <br> like React and tools like Git for version control.k</p>
<p>If you are just starting out , i encourage you to experiment , make mistakes , and most importantly, have <br> fun with it . HTML is just the beginning â€” the real magic happens when you keep going. </p>
